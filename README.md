# FCONN
This is an updated MERN stack version of the Old_FCONN project. It will also be available on mobile and a mobile web app.

To start up the project:
Make sure you have node.js and bootstrap installed.

Run 
    npm start 

This will start up the localhost react app.

Don't forget:
1. When working in react, you need to import the components you want to use. If you get errors similar to can't find useState, you need to import that like:
    import {useState} from "react";

2. This is the same for all components. Each component if used in a certain view, needs to be imported.
